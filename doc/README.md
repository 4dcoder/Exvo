Setup
---------------------
[EXVO Core](https://github.com/squbs/exvo/releases) is the original EXVO client and it builds the backbone of the network. However, it downloads and stores the entire history of EXVO transactions; depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few minutes to hours or a day or more. Thankfully you only have to do this once.
